# MAC

These are the functions of Mac :-

1. Logical-channel multiplexing
2. Hybrid-ARQ retransmission
3. Scheduling
4. Multiplexing/Demultiplexing for carrier aggregation 

### Multiplexing Logical Channel

MAC layer provides the services to the RLC in the form of logical channels.

MAC layer uses services from PHY layer in the form of transport channel.

**Logical Channel:** It defined by the "types of information" it carries and its generally classified as control chaannel (used for the transmission and configuration information necessary for operating in oue system and as a traffic channel (used for the user data).   

**Transport Channel:** It is defined by "how and with what characteristic information" is transmitted over the radio interface. This includes paging, broadcast or shared channel.

Logical Channel have: <br />
a) Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH)<br />
b) Paging Control Channel (PCCH)<br />
c) Common Control Channel (CCCH)<br />
d) Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH)<br />
e) Dedicated Traffic Control Channel (DTCH)<br />

Tansport Channel have:<br />
a) Broadcast Channel (BCH)<br />
b) Paging Channel (PCH)<br />
c) Downlink Shared Channel (DL-SCH)<br />
d) Uplink Shared Channel (UL-SCH)<br />
e) Random Access Channel (RACH)<br />
